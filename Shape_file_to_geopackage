### Python 

import geopandas as gpd

# Define the path to the input shapefile
shapefile_path = r"path\shapefilenameVM.shp"  # Replace with your shapefile path

# Define the path to the output GeoPackage

# Load the shapefile using GeoPandas
gdf = gpd.read_file(shapefile_path)

# Define the layer name for the GeoPackage (usually the same as the shapefile name without extension)
layer_name = shapefile_path.split('\\')[-1].replace('.shp', '')

# Save the GeoDataFrame to a GeoPackage
gdf.to_file(output_gpkg_path, layer=layer_name, driver="GPKG")
